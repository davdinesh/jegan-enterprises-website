# Complete GitHub Pages Deployment Setup Guide

## 🎯 Current Situation

You have two deployment workflow files:
1. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - **Official GitHub Actions** (requires external actions)
2. `.github/workflows/deploy-alternative.yml` - **Alternative method** (no external actions needed)

**Error you're seeing**:
```
Actions not allowed because all actions must be from a repository owned by davdinesh
```

## ✅ Choose Your Deployment Method

You have **TWO options**. Choose one:

### **Option 1: Official GitHub Actions** (Recommended) ⭐

**Pros**:

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires allowing external actions

**Setup Time**: 1 minute

---

### **Option 2: Alternative Method (gh-pages)**

**Pros**:
- ✅ Works with strict action permissions
- ✅ No need to change repository settings

**Cons**:

- ❌ Requires different Pages configuration

**Setup Time**: 2 minutes

---

## 📋 Option 1: Official GitHub Actions Setup

### Step 1: Enable External Actions

1. **Go to Actions Settings**:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/settings/actions
   ```

2. **Under "Actions permissions"**, select:
   ```
   ✅ Allow all actions and reusable workflows
   ```

3. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Pages Settings**:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Under "Source"**, select:
   ```
   ✅ GitHub Actions
   ```

3. **Click "Save"**

### Step 3: Disable Alternative Workflow

1. **Rename or delete** `.github/workflows/deploy-alternative.yml`

   ```bash
   # If you have local repository
   cd jegan-enterprises-website
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git rm .github/workflows/deploy-alternative.yml
   git commit -m "Remove alternative workflow, using official GitHub Actions"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 4: Trigger Deployment

1. **Go to Actions**:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions
   ```

2. **Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages"**

3. **Click "Run workflow"** → Select `main` → **"Run workflow"**

4. **Wait 1-2 minutes**

### Step 5: Verify

Visit: `https://davdinesh.github.io/jegan-enterprises-website`

✅ **Done!** Future pushes to main will auto-deploy.

---

## 📋 Option 2: Alternative Method Setup

### Step 1: Keep Permissions Strict

No need to change Actions permissions - keep current settings.

### Step 2: Disable Official Workflow

1. **Rename** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled`

   ```bash
   # If you have local repository
   cd jegan-enterprises-website
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   mv .github/workflows/deploy.yml .github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled
   git add .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "Disable official workflow, using alternative method"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Enable Alternative Workflow

The alternative workflow is already in `.github/workflows/deploy-alternative.yml`

### Step 4: Configure GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Pages Settings**:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Under "Source"**, select:
   ```
   ✅ Deploy from a branch
   ```

3. **Branch**: Select `gh-pages` / **Root**

4. **Click "Save"**

### Step 5: Trigger Deployment

1. **Go to Actions**:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions
   ```

2. **Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages (Alternative)"**

3. **Click "Run workflow"** → Select `main` → **"Run workflow"**

4. **Wait 1-2 minutes**

   The workflow will:
   - Build the site
   - Deploy to `gh-pages` branch
   - GitHub Pages will publish from that branch

### Step 6: Verify

Visit: `https://davdinesh.github.io/jegan-enterprises-website`

✅ **Done!** Future pushes to main will auto-deploy.

## 🔄 Switching Between Methods

### From Alternative → Official:

```bash
# 1. Enable external actions in Settings → Actions
# 2. Then:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git rm .github/workflows/deploy-alternative.yml
git mv .github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Switch to official GitHub Actions deployment"
git push origin main

# 3. Change Pages source to "GitHub Actions"
# 4. Trigger workflow manually
```

### From Official → Alternative:

```bash
# No need to change action permissions
# 1. Then:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git mv .github/workflows/deploy.yml .github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled
git commit -m "Switch to alternative deployment method"
git push origin main

# 2. Change Pages source to "Deploy from a branch" → "gh-pages"
# 3. Trigger alternative workflow manually
```

## 🎯 Our Recommendation

**Use Option 1 (Official GitHub Actions)** because:
- It's the modern standard
- Faster deployments
- Better error reporting
- GitHub maintains it
- Easier to troubleshoot

**The external actions are safe** - they're official GitHub actions used by millions of repos.
