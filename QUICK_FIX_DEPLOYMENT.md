# Quick Fix: GitHub Pages Deployment Issue

## 🚨 Current Situation

**Merged to main**: ✅ Code successfully merged
**GitHub Actions**: ❌ Not deploying to GitHub Pages

---

## 🎯 Most Likely Issue

**GitHub Pages Source Not Set to "GitHub Actions"**

This is the #1 reason deployments don't work after setting up the workflow.

---

## ✅ Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages Source

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Under "Source"**:
   - Current might be: "Deploy from a branch" ❌
   - Change to: **"GitHub Actions"** ✅

3. **Click "Save"**

4. **Wait**: GitHub will automatically trigger deployment

---

### Step 2: Verify Actions Are Enabled

1. **Go to Actions Settings**:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/settings/actions
   ```

2. **Ensure "Actions permissions" is enabled**:
   - Should be: ✅ "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"

3. **Check "Workflow permissions"**:
   - Should be: ✅ "Read and write permissions"
   - Check: ✅ "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

4. **Save** if you made any changes

---

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment

#### Option A: Manual Workflow Trigger (Fastest)

1. **Go to Actions Tab**:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions
   ```

2. **Click** "Deploy to GitHub Pages" (in left sidebar)

3. **Click** "Run workflow" button (top right)

4. **Select** branch: `main`

5. **Click** green "Run workflow" button

6. **Wait** 1-2 minutes

7. **Check** deployment at:
   ```
   https://davdinesh.github.io/jegan-enterprises-website
   ```

---

#### Option B: Push Empty Commit

If you have the repository cloned locally:

```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd jegan-enterprises-website

# Ensure you're on main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create empty commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to trigger workflow
git push origin main
```

Then monitor:
```
https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions
```

## 📊 How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Actions Tab

Visit: `https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions`

**You should see**:
- New workflow run appear (within 5-10 seconds)
- Yellow circle → changes to green checkmark (after ~1-2 minutes)
- Two jobs: "build" and "deploy" (both should succeed)

---

### 2. Check Pages Settings

Visit: `https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/settings/pages`

**You should see**:
```
✅ Your site is live at https://davdinesh.github.io/jegan-enterprises-website
```

---

### 3. Check Live Site

Visit: `https://davdinesh.github.io/jegan-enterprises-website`

**You should see**:
- No testimonials section ✅
- 5 navigation items (not 6) ✅
- All other sections working ✅

**If site looks old**:
- Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Try incognito/private window
- Wait 2-5 minutes for CDN propagation

## 🔍 Still Not Working?

### Check Workflow Run Details

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Click on "build" job - should show:
   ```
   ✅ Checkout
   ✅ Setup Node.js
   ✅ Install dependencies
   ✅ Build
   ✅ Upload artifact
   ```

4. Click on "deploy" job - should show:
   ```
   ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages
   ```

**If any step fails**:
- Click on the failed step
- Read error message
- Common issues:
  - Dependencies error → Delete `node_modules`, reinstall
  - Build error → Check for syntax errors in code
  - Deploy error → Check permissions (Step 2 above)
