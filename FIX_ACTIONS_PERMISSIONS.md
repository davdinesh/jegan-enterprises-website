# Fix: GitHub Actions Permission Error

## üö® Error Message

```
The actions actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-node@v4, actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3,
and actions/deploy-pages@v4 are not allowed in davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website
because all actions must be from a repository owned by davdinesh.
```

## ‚úÖ Solution: Update Repository Actions Permissions

Your repository has a security restriction that only allows actions from repositories you own. We need to allow the official GitHub actions.

### **Step 1: Update Actions Permissions**

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/settings/actions
   ```

2. **Find "Actions permissions" section**

3. **Select ONE of these options**:

   **Option A: Allow All Actions (Recommended)** ‚úÖ
   - ‚úÖ **"Allow all actions and reusable workflows"**
   - This allows any action from GitHub Marketplace
   - Safe for public repositories
   - Allows official GitHub actions like `actions/checkout@v4`

   **Option B: Allow Selected Actions**
   - ‚úÖ **"Allow [organization]/[repository], and select non-[organization]/[repository], actions and reusable workflows"**
   - Add these to the allow list:
     ```
     actions/checkout@*,
     actions/setup-node@*,
     actions/upload-pages-artifact@*,
     actions/deploy-pages@*,
     actions/configure-pages@*
     ```

4. **Click "Save"**

---

### **Step 2: Trigger Deployment**

After updating permissions:

1. **Go to Actions tab**:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions
   ```

2. **Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages"** (left sidebar)

3. **Click "Run workflow"** button

4. **Select branch**: `main`

5. **Click "Run workflow"**

6. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for deployment

---

## üîí Why This Restriction Exists

GitHub allows repository owners to control which actions can run for security:

- **Default**: Allow all actions (most permissive)
- **Restricted**: Only actions from your organization
- **Custom**: Manually specify allowed actions

Your repository is currently set to **"Restricted"** mode.

---

## ‚úÖ Safe to Allow These Actions?

**YES** - These are official GitHub actions:

- ‚úÖ `actions/checkout@v4` - Official GitHub action to checkout code
- ‚úÖ `actions/setup-node@v4` - Official GitHub action to setup Node.js
- ‚úÖ `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` - Official GitHub action for Pages
- ‚úÖ `actions/deploy-pages@v4` - Official GitHub action for Pages deployment

All maintained by GitHub: `https://github.com/actions`

---

## üîÑ Alternative Solution: Use gh-pages Package

If you prefer not to change Actions permissions, you can deploy using the `gh-pages` npm package instead.

### Update Workflow to Use gh-pages

Replace `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        run: |
          git clone https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}.git .
          git checkout ${{ github.ref_name }}

      - name: Setup Node.js
        run: |
          curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
          sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        env:
          CI: false

      - name: Deploy to gh-pages
        run: |
          git config --global user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git config --global user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          npx gh-pages -d build -m "Deploy from GitHub Actions [skip ci]"
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Then **also update GitHub Pages settings**:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Source: **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Branch: **"gh-pages"** / **"root"**
4. Save

## üìä Comparison: Which Method to Use?

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **GitHub Actions (Official)** | ‚úÖ Recommended by GitHub<br>‚úÖ Faster deployment<br>‚úÖ Better integration<br>‚úÖ Official support | ‚ùå Requires allowing external actions |
| **gh-pages Package** | ‚úÖ No external actions needed<br>‚úÖ Works with strict permissions | ‚ùå Slightly slower<br>‚ùå More steps<br>‚ùå Less integrated |

**Recommendation**: Use **GitHub Actions (Official)** method - it's the modern standard.

## üéØ Quick Fix Steps (1 minute)

### For Official GitHub Actions Method:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/settings/actions`
2. Select: **"Allow all actions and reusable workflows"**
3. Click: **"Save"**
4. Go to: `https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions`
5. Click: **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"** ‚Üí **"Run workflow"**
6. Done! ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After fixing and deploying:

1. **Check Actions tab**:
   - Should show workflow running/completed
   - No permission errors
   - Green checkmarks on all steps

2. **Check Pages settings**:
   - Should show "Your site is live at..."

3. **Visit site**:
   ```
   https://davdinesh.github.io/jegan-enterprises-website
   ```
   - Clear cache: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
   - Verify no testimonials section
   - Verify 5 navigation items

## üêõ If You Still See Errors

### Common Issues After Permission Change:

1. **Workflow doesn't run automatically**:
   - Manually trigger it from Actions tab

2. **Different error appears**:
   - Check the new error message
   - Verify GitHub Pages source is set correctly
   - Check workflow permissions are "Read and write"

3. **Site doesn't update**:
   - Wait 2-5 minutes for CDN propagation
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try incognito/private browsing

## üîí Security Note

**Is it safe to allow all actions?**

**For public repositories**: YES ‚úÖ
- GitHub Actions run in isolated environments
- Actions from `actions/*` are official and trusted
- Widely used across millions of repositories

**For private repositories**: Consider carefully
- Evaluate which actions you trust
- Use "Allow select actions" for fine-grained control

---

## üöÄ Expected Results After Fix

```
‚úÖ Workflow runs without permission errors
‚úÖ Build job completes successfully
‚úÖ Deploy job completes successfully
‚úÖ GitHub Pages shows "site is live"
‚úÖ Website accessible at GitHub Pages URL
‚úÖ Changes reflected on live site
```
