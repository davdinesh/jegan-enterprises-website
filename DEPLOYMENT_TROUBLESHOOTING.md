# GitHub Actions Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 Issue: GitHub Pages Not Deploying After Merge

The code has been merged to main branch, but GitHub Actions is not deploying to GitHub Pages.

---

## ✅ Quick Diagnostic Steps

### 1. **Check GitHub Actions Status**

Visit your repository's Actions tab:
```
https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions
```

**What to look for**:
- ✅ **Green checkmark** = Workflow succeeded
- ❌ **Red X** = Workflow failed
- 🟡 **Yellow circle** = Workflow in progress
- ⚪ **Gray circle** = Workflow queued/waiting

### 2. **Verify GitHub Pages Settings**

Go to repository Settings → Pages:
```
https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/settings/pages
```

**Required Configuration**:
- ✅ **Source**: Must be set to "GitHub Actions" (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
- ✅ **Branch**: Should show deployment from main via Actions
- ✅ **Status**: Should show "Your site is live at..."

**If NOT configured correctly**:
1. Click on "Source" dropdown
2. Select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Save changes
4. Wait for next push or manually trigger workflow

---

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: GitHub Pages Source Not Set to "GitHub Actions"

**Symptom**: Workflow runs but site doesn't update

**Solution**:
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Change Source from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Save
4. Manually trigger workflow (see below)

---

### Issue 2: Workflow Permissions Not Enabled

**Symptom**: Workflow fails with permission errors

**Solution**:
1. Go to Settings → Actions → General
2. Scroll to "Workflow permissions"
3. Select **"Read and write permissions"**
4. Check ✅ "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
5. Save
6. Re-run failed workflow

---

### Issue 3: Pages Environment Not Created

**Symptom**: Deploy step fails with "environment not found"

**Solution**:
1. Go to Settings → Environments
2. If "github-pages" doesn't exist, it will be created automatically on first successful run
3. If it exists but has restrictions, verify:
   - No deployment protection rules blocking it
   - No branch restrictions

---

### Issue 4: Workflow Not Triggering on Push

**Symptom**: No workflow runs after merge

**Solution**:
1. Verify `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists in main branch
2. Check workflow file syntax (YAML must be valid)
3. Ensure workflow has correct trigger:
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   ```
4. Manually trigger workflow (see below)

---

### Issue 5: Build Succeeds But Deploy Fails

**Symptom**: Build job passes, deploy job fails

**Solution**:
Check deploy step error logs:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on failed workflow run
3. Click on "deploy" job
4. Check error messages

Common errors:
- **"Artifact not found"**: Build job didn't upload artifact correctly
- **"Permission denied"**: Workflow permissions issue (see Issue 2)
- **"Environment github-pages not found"**: See Issue 3

---

## 🔧 Manual Deployment Triggers

### Method 1: Empty Commit (Recommended)

Force a new workflow run by making an empty commit:

```bash
# Create empty commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

This will trigger the workflow without changing any code.

---

### Method 2: Manual Workflow Dispatch

Trigger the workflow manually from GitHub:

1. Go to Actions tab:
   ```
   https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions
   ```

2. Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow (left sidebar)

3. Click "Run workflow" button (top right)

4. Select branch: **main**

5. Click green "Run workflow" button

6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

---

### Method 3: Re-run Failed Workflow

If a workflow failed:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Click "Re-run all jobs" button (top right)
4. Workflow will restart

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Verification

### Step 1: Verify Workflow File Exists

```bash
# Check if workflow file exists
ls -la .github/workflows/deploy.yml

# Should output: .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

✅ **File exists** - Continue to Step 2
❌ **File not found** - Workflow file missing, need to recreate

---

### Step 2: Check Last Workflow Run

Visit:
```
https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions
```

**Expected**: Should see workflow runs for recent commits

**If no workflow runs appear**:
- Workflow file might not be in main branch
- GitHub Actions might be disabled
- YAML syntax error in workflow file

---

### Step 3: Review Workflow Logs

1. Click on most recent workflow run
2. Check both jobs:
   - **build** job - Should show successful build
   - **deploy** job - Should show successful deployment

**Look for**:
- Green checkmarks ✅
- Red error messages ❌
- Yellow warnings ⚠️

---

### Step 4: Verify Site Deployment

After successful workflow:

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Look for: **"Your site is live at [URL]"**
3. Click the URL or visit:
   ```
   https://davdinesh.github.io/jegan-enterprises-website
   ```

4. **Clear browser cache**: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

5. Verify changes are live

## 🔍 Detailed Diagnostics

### Check Workflow File Syntax

```bash
# View workflow file
cat .github/workflows/deploy.yml

# Check for syntax errors
# YAML is sensitive to indentation - must use spaces, not tabs
```

---

### Check GitHub Pages Status

```bash
# View current Pages configuration (via GitHub CLI if available)
gh api repos/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/pages

# OR visit in browser
# https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/settings/pages
```

---

### Check Recent Deployments

Visit deployments page:
```
https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/deployments
```

**What to look for**:
- Recent deployment to "github-pages" environment
- Deployment status (Active/Inactive)
- Deployment commit SHA

---

## 🚀 Force Deployment Now

If you want to force a deployment immediately:

### Option 1: Push Empty Commit

```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch

# Push to trigger workflow
git push origin main

# Monitor deployment
# Visit: https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions
```

---

### Option 2: Make Small Change

```bash
# Make a small change (update README)
echo "" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 Quick Fix Checklist

Try these in order:

- [ ] Verify GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- [ ] Check workflow file exists in `.github/workflows/`
- [ ] Review Actions tab for workflow runs
- [ ] Check workflow permissions (read/write)
- [ ] Manually trigger workflow via "workflow_dispatch"
- [ ] Push empty commit to trigger deployment
- [ ] Clear browser cache and revisit site
- [ ] Wait 2-5 minutes for propagation

---

## 📊 Expected Workflow Timeline

Normal deployment timeline:

1. **Commit pushed to main** (0:00)
2. **Workflow triggered** (0:05 - 5 seconds)
3. **Build job starts** (0:10 - 10 seconds)
4. **Dependencies installed** (0:15 - ~30 seconds)
5. **Project built** (0:45 - ~45 seconds)
6. **Artifact uploaded** (1:00 - ~15 seconds)
7. **Deploy job starts** (1:05 - 5 seconds)
8. **Deployment completes** (1:15 - ~10 seconds)
9. **Site live** (1:30 - ~15 seconds propagation)

**Total time**: ~1.5 to 2 minutes

---

## 🔄 Current Status Check

**Last merge commit**: `459b9da`

**Expected behavior**: GitHub Actions should have triggered automatically

**To verify now**:
```bash
# Check if workflow ran for this commit
# Visit: https://github.com/davdinesh/jegan-enterprises-website/actions
# Look for workflow run with commit message: "Merge pull request #5..."
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Bookmark Actions page** for quick access to deployment status
2. **Enable email notifications** for failed workflows (Settings → Notifications)
3. **Use workflow_dispatch** trigger for manual deployments when needed
4. **Monitor first deployment closely** to catch any configuration issues
5. **Clear cache** when checking updates (browser caching can hide changes)

---

**Need immediate help?** Push an empty commit to trigger deployment now:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Deploy: Remove testimonials section" && git push origin main
```
